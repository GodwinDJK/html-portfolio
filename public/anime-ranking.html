<h1>The Best Anime According to Komi Godwin</h1>
    <h2>My top 10 Anime of all-time.</h2>
    <hr />
        <h3>One Piece</h3>
            <p>I love it because this anime teach you the value of the family.</p>
        <h3>Naruto</h3>
            <p>This anime teach me that the hard work can improve my skills.</p>
        <h3>Dr. Stone</h3>
            <p>The story of New World centers around Senkuu and his team's journey to reach the source of the green light that petrified humanity.</p>
        <h3>Demon Slayer</h3>
            <p>Ah ufotable, the studio that keeps on giving. Before Kimetsu no Yaiba aired, news broke out that we'd get them animating the show. And to my delight, it's a studio that earned its praise for its high caliber animation
            and consistently delivering quality content. Being their first 2-cour show (without a split cour break), Kimetsu no Yaiba is a special gift not just for the manga fans but anyone ready to experience a world of demons 
            and dark fantasy.</p>
        <h3>My Hero Academia</h3>
            <p>Inspired by American superhero comics, Horikoshi Kouhei's Boku no Hero Academia (or 'My Hero Academia' in English) manga started publishing two years ago, but got gained a lot of popularity only after the release of 
            One Punch Man anime. But being honest here, I must say that I was somewhat disappointed by it.</p>
        <h3>Hunter X Hunter</h3>
            <p>I don't have words enough to describe what was this 148 episodes for me.
            I'll not spend this review talking about the Synopsis, because It's right here on MAL.
            I need to tell you, why you must watch this masterpiece, and what it represents to me.</p>
        <h3>The God Of High School</h3>
            <p>The second webtoon anime comes to a close. Definitely say I liked this one better than the previous. God of High School does have some problems no doubt but I enjoyed this anime so damn much. Didn't quite know what 
            was coming with this show other than a big tournament and some cool looking fights. Well we got that in spades and then some! This show didn't let up off the throttle for even a half second! Kept going and going and 
            going jumping the shark at every turn and I loved for doing that. Where we started and where we ended were completely different.</p>
        <h3>Zom 100</h3>
            <p>La realtà è lì, esiste e basta. Il mondo in cui vivi può diventare un inferno o un paradiso a seconda di come lo guardi e lo interpreti! - Haro Aso.</p>
        <h3>Dragon Ball</h3>
            <p>This won't be an in depth review because everyone knows about Dragon Ball and its influence and there are already numerous reviews written about it. This will just give you an idea of whether you should watch it or 
            not, for those who haven't yet.
            <br />
            Dragon Ball undeservedly doesn't receive the same attention as its more popular sequel. The Dragon Ball series does receive a lot of flack for being really repetitive and for its unnecessarily long fight sequences 
            but it's really unfair to compare the franchise to what the shonen genre has become today. Because of this people tend to overlook Dragon Ball.</p>
        <h3>Mob Psycho 100</h3>
            <p>There's probably a million ways to describe Mob Psycho 100. One simple word is just exciting. How can it not be? It's by the same creator of one of the most talked about shows from 2015, One-Punch Man. As a reader 
            of the source material, I can also firmly say that the show's trailers and hype is legitimate. Not in the legitimate way that it's the best anime of the century. It's more of legitimate excellency that represents 
            classic supernatural entertainment.</p>
